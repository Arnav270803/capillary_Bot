Capillary Bot

Overview
Capillary Bot is a simple, AI-powered chatbot designed to help developers and users quickly navigate and understand CapillaryTech's documentation. Whether you're new to their APIs, onboarding processes, or features like InTouch trackers and customer management, this bot pulls relevant info from official docs and delivers clear, structured answers with code snippets and citations.
Think of it as your personal docs assistant: Ask "How do I authenticate with the API?" and get a step-by-step response with examplesâ€”no more digging through pages. It's built for ease, using free tools and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup to keep answers accurate and grounded in real docs.
This project was thrown together as a weekend hack to streamline CapillaryTech queries, but it's production-ready for personal use or small teams.
