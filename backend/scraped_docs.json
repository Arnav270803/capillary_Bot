This flow uses an access token to authenticate an API request. You can enable oAuth from InTouch as mentioned in the respective section below.\nBasic auth\nThis is used where POS terminals are directly integrated with Capillary server. This flow uses Till ID and MD5 hash encoded password to authenticate an API request. Find more details in the section below.\nAuthentication for end-customer web and mobile apps\nThis is used for end-customer authentication where you want end-customers to login to a mobile or web application built on Capillary CDP.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nIt is mandatory to use only store-specific Till/Store Center credentials as API response depends on this identification.\nWhen to use Basic & OAuth?\nAuthentication Type\nDescription\nBasic\nCan be used for POS integrations where API requests come to the Capillary server directly from POS front end or POS store server.\noAuth\nShall be used for backend integrations (from one backend to another backend).

For example, if the gross bill amount is $120 and the discount is $20, the (net) bill amount is $100.\nTransaction discount\nCreate tracker cases based on the discount amount of a transaction.\nTransaction gross amount\nCreate tracker cases based on the gross transaction amount (without discount). For example, if the net bill amount is $100 after a discount of $20, the gross bill amount is $120.\nTransaction total quantity\nCreate tracker cases based on the total quantity of all line items purchased during the tracker period. For example, if a customer makes 10 transactions with 20 line items of quantity 3 each in 90 days, then the bill total quantity is 60.\nLine-item amount\nCreate tracker cases based on the purchase value of individual line items.\nLine-item count\nCreate tracker cases based on the number of line items purchased.

For example, a customer can have 10 transactions with 22 line items for 90 days. The number of line items purchased could be 50.\nCustomer visits\nCreate tracker cases based on the count of unique bills of a customer.\nPoints\nCreate tracker cases based on the number of points earned during the tracking period.\nTransaction extended field\nCreate tracker cases on a transaction-level extended field.

You can use extended fields with datatypes Integer or Double.\nIn the\nTracking Method\n, select any of the following methods to track entities.\nMethod\nDescription\nMoving Window\nIn Moving Window mode, when a customer makes a transaction, the tracker condition is checked for the previous X days or months (number of days or months set in\nTrack for ___ days/months\n) until the transaction date.\nBased on the cycle in which a transaction falls, the tracker cases are evaluated from starting of that cycle until the transaction date. Consider the following examples:\nMoving window (days):\nA tracker was set up on April 5, 2025, to reward 200 bonus points if a customer spends $1000 within a 20-day period. For each transaction, the system looks back 20 days to calculate the total spend. So, for a purchase made on April 7, the tracker checks spend from March 18 to April 7. For a purchase on May 4, it checks from April 15 to May 4, and so on.\nThis means the window shifts with every transaction, and the set of transactions included in the calculation can change daily.\nMoving window (months):\nA tracker was set up on April 5, 2025, to reward 200 bonus points if a customer spends $1000 within a 1-month period. With month-based logic, the system includes full calendar months in the tracker window and will always start from the 1st of the previous month. So, if purchases are made on March 10th and April 10th, the system considers the spends from March 1st to April 30th. If another purchase is made on May 1st, the window shifts forward\u2014dropping March\u2014and now includes April 1st to May 31st. This approach ensures more stable and predictable tracking by updating only once per month.\nTo track from the start of the same month, enter the value of\nTrack for ___\nas\n. For example, if a purchase is made on 10th April 10th, and\nTrack for ___\n=\n, the system considers spend from April 1st to April 30th.\nCyclic Window\nIn Cyclic Window mode, when a customer makes a transaction for the first time after the tracker is configured, cycles of equal intervals are created for that customer based on the transaction date. The duration of each cycle depends on the value set in\nTrack for ___ days\n.\nBased on the cycle in which a transaction falls, the tracker cases are evaluated from starting of that cycle until the transaction date. Consider the following example:\nA tracker was created on Apr 5, 2019, with a condition to reward a bonus of 200 points on a transaction of $1000 in 20 days (\nTrack for ___ days\n).\nAssume that a customer makes subsequent transactions on Apr 7, May 4, 10, and 22.\n- In Cyclic Window mode, based on the first transaction date (Apr 7) of the customer (after the strategy is configured), cycles are created with equal intervals of 20 days each.For the first transaction ( Apr 7) the condition is checked only for that day. As the second transaction falls in Cycle 2 (May 4), the condition is checked from starting of the second cycle until the transaction day (Apr 27 - May 4). Similarly, the fourth transaction falls in Cycle 3 and the condition is checked from May 27 - May 22.\nCalendar Based Cyclic Window\nCycles of calendar months are created based on the Start Date and the number of months set irrespective of the transaction date.\nFor example, if a Calendar based Cyclic Window is created with the start date Apr 5 and the number of months 3, then the cycles are created for three calendar months as shown in the illustration below. Then, based on the date of the transaction, the corresponding cycle will be considered.\nTier Change Window\nCalculates tracker values considering the last tier change date. For example, if a customer's tier changed on Aug 2, 2020, tracker values will be calculated from Aug 2, 2020, until the current date.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nNote\nTrackers need to be incorporated in Workflows to define when they need to be evaluated and what happens when the milestone conditions are met.\nIn\nCase Name\n, enter the name for the current tracker case.\nUnder\nTrack For\n, enter the duration of the window to evaluate the tracker case.\nSelect a\nUnit\nfrom the dropdown menu, choosing between months or days.\nIn\nWhat are the tracker's milestones\n, select any of the following options for two fields and enter the desired value.\nDefine the condition of that tracker case in this field. For example, if the Sum of transactions in\n365 days\nare\nEqual to$1000\n.\nField 1\n:\nOption\nDescription\nSum\nIt is the total of tracked entity values for the specified duration.\nFor example for Bill Amount, the sum is the total value of all transactions (amount) tracked for a set duration.\nCount\nIt is the number of times the entity is tracked in a specified duration.\nFor example, for Bill Amount, the count is the number of transactions tracked for a specified time period.\nField 2\n:\nOption\nDescription\nEqual to\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is the same as the configured value\nGreater than\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is more than the configured value.\nLess than\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is less than the configured value.\nGreater than or Equal to\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is either equal to or more than the configured value.\nLess than or Equal to\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count is either equal to or less than the configured value.\nMod of\nBetween\nThe condition becomes true if the Sum or Count falls between the two configured values.\nEnable\nLimit No. of forwards per customer\nand enter the value to limit the execution of the current tracker case.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nNote\nOnce the case is executed successfully for X times for a customer (where X is the value specified in this field), the tracker case will not be evaluated for that customer again.\nYou can add multiple tracker cases by clicking\nAdd Tracker Case\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nNote\nYou can see the configured tracker case in\nPreview\n.\nEditing a Tracker\nTo edit a tracker, follow these steps:\nIn the Intouch homepage, go to\nLoyalty+\n>\nPrograms\n.\nIn\nPrograms\n, scroll down and select the program you want to edit.\nClick\nEdit Program\nand scroll down to the\nTrackers\nsection.\nClick\nTrackers\n, select the menu button next to the tracker you want to edit, and choose\nEdit\n.\nMake the necessary changes and select\nSave\n.\nThe tracker is now edited successfully.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nNote\nWhen editing the name or case name for a tracker, update the same name under the tracker sets and point tracker sets under the\nworkflow section\nif used.\nAdding Trackers in Workflows\nOnce you create a tracker strategy, it is important to configure rule sets to start tracking entities set in tracker strategies, evaluate tracker cases, and trigger actions upon successful execution of tracker cases.\nTo configure tracker-based rules, go to the\nWorkflows\npage and select\nMakes a transaction\n(Transaction Add) customer activity (It is usually going to be the activity selected by default).\nThe first parent set (Set1) is for new transaction activity, the second one is the TrackerSet where you can define rules on tracker cases. The last parent set is for the transaction finished activity.\nWhen a transaction is made, the first set is invoked and forwards to the second set. The second set validates all the trackers and executes actions based on the rules and actions configured. The event then gets forwarded to the third set which completes the transaction event.\nTo create tracker based rules, do the following\n:\nOn the\nEventsView\npage, choose\nTransactionAdd\nevent and navigate to TrackerSet.\nClick\n+Condition\n.\nLeave\nExpression\nand\nExpression equals\nto true.\nIn the\nWhen\nfield, click + and select the default\nForward to\nSet action using **+Add action **> Click\nSave\n>\nEnable transaction item\n> Click\nSave\n.\nA new tracker is created under the TrackerSet as shown above. The tracker name is generated by default. You cannot modify the tracker name. You can tag a tracker strategy to the tracker. Tag a tracker strategy to the tracker as explained in the following.\nNavigate to the child tracker set. In the\nWhen\ncondition click + and Select the\nTracker Evaluation\naction and click Save.\nIn\nAdd tracker evaluation action\n, choose the tracker case for which you want to configure rules.\nIn\nTrackers\n(Action field), choose the tracker strategy that you want to tag for the tracker and click\nSave\n.\nSimilarly, you can create multiple child tracker sets under the parent set. To know how to configure rules, see\nConfiguring Events\n.\nUsing Trackers in Tiers\nTrackers offer very powerful means of controlling tier eligibilities and renewal conditions based on recency, for example, you can upgrade a customer based on visits in the last 1 year or purchases in a calendar month and renew based on purchases made as part of Gold Tier.\nTo setup:\nSelect \u201cTracker\u201d as part of Eligibility criteria or Renewal Conditions.\nYou will also be required to select a \u2018Tracker Case\u2019, however this is only for the purpose of the tracking duration - the values for eligibility or renewal are as per the values set in the tier strategy and not the milestones.\nYou will still need to include the Tracker and properly set it up inside workflows for the values to be evaluated and the the tier upgrades to work smoothly\n\ud83d\udcd8\nNote\nIt is recommended that \u201cTier Change Window\u201d type trackers are used for Renewal in most cases\nMilestone based Loyalty using Trackers\nYou can setup the Loyalty Program to be able to celebrate milestones as part of the customer\u2019s journey in the Loyalty Program or during certain seasonal time periods. For example, you can award a coupon to a customer if they make 5 visits within the first year of membership or 500 bonus points to a customer on shopping for $1000 once they reach the Gold Tier.\nTo setup, you can create the milestones  by setting up all 4 steps inside the Tracker as explained above. You can then set the appropriate actions inside the different Tracker Case rulesets.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nNote\nOne Tracker can have multiple milestones\nPoints Allocation inside Trackers\nWhen you allocate points inside trackers, using the percentage allocation method, whatever is the tracked entity becomes the source value.\nUpdated\n3 months ago\nAsk AI"

      "Event notification\nEvent Notifications is a framework that provides near real-time data of events generated in the Capillary System and helps brands subscribe to notifications about particular events.\nOverview\nEvent Notification allows building integrations with Capillary events that originate either through Capillary API (such as customerAdded and transactionAdded)requests or Capillary products such as Loyalty+ (such as pointsIssued and pointsRedeemed), Engage+ or other. Once an event notification is configured, brands can build custom solutions to trigger for pre-configured actions.\nEvent Notifications are sent through Webhooks configured in Capillary Event Notifications. The following is the top-level diagram, of the Events Notification framework (ENS).\nUse Cases\nThere are several use cases of event notifications. A couple of examples are provided in the following.\nEnable PII-less Communication\nIn some cases, brands prefer not to send customers' personally identifiable information (PII data) such as names, email ID, and mobile number to Capillary and manage communication completely at their end. Event Notification can be used to get the events that require communication such as customer registration, transaction, points issual, points redemption, points transfer, etc. On receiving these events, clients can send communication to customers with their names and identifiers as needed.\nIntegration with 3rd Party Applications\nEvent notification can be used to build integrations with 3rd party applications. For example, send a survey link to a customer post transaction event from a survey application such as Medallia; sync customer\u2019s loyalty information to an e-commerce platform such as Magento. Integration can be built to receive real-time events, enrich information using Capillary APIs (if required), and sync it to the 3rd party application using the brand's APIs.\nSteps involved in ENS set up\nThe following are the steps involved in the set up of the Event Notification Service (ENS) for a client.\nWebhook creation\nWebhooks let you create an integration URL that is required to post events data from ENS to Webhook. Before starting with the configuration process, you need to create a Webhook account and generate a URL. The URL is further used to post events generated by the client (This can be done by creating an API proxy for API Gateway such as Apigee).\nEvent Notification Configuration\nOnce you have the Webhook URL, you need to subscribe to the events that need to be notified. This can be done either through UI or API. For more details, see\nAdd Event Notification\nEvent Consumption\nOnce the setup is completed, the client can consume and process events data and use the data to configure actions to trigger. For more details see,\nConsuming event notification\nAt present notification the following event notifcations can be configured:\nrewardIssued\n: Notification that a reward has been issued to a

      "Ask AI\nTransaction (V1)\nA transaction represents a purchase or return event. Based on the customers\u2019 loyalty status, transactions are categorized into three types.\nLoyalty Transactions\n: Transactions made by registered customers of your organization\u2019s loyalty program. A customer can be tagged to a loyalty transaction.\nNon-loyalty Transactions\n: Transactions made by customers who are not registered into your loyalty program, but subscribed their mobile number or email id with the organization. These transactions are tagged to the respective identifiers (mobile no/email id)\nNot-interested Transactions\n: Transactions made by customers who are not interested to register into your organization\u2019s loyalty program. These transactions are also considered as anonymous transactions.\nTransactions are again classified into the following types:\nRegular\n: Normal transactions made at the PoS. Regular transactions could be loyalty, non-loyalty and not-interested.\nReturn\n: Transactions that are returned at the PoS. Return transactions need an identifier reference. Hence, only loyalty and non-loyalty transactions can be returned through APIs. See Transaction Return API for more details.\nMixed\n: A transaction that involves both regular and return is termed as mixed transaction.\nThe transaction entity contains all the necessary APIs to manage transactions and retrieve transaction details. The transaction entity stores regular/return transactions, points/coupons redeemed against transactions, retro transactions (converting not interested transactions to loyalty), extended fields, and custom fields.\nFor information on how the system handles different timezones, see\nHandling different timezone\n.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nExtended fields and custom fields in transactions are used to capture additional information of a transaction or transaction line-item. The extended fields are predefined defined in the system with specific values, whereas, custom fields can have any name and value as required for the org.\nPrerequisites\nBefore using transaction APIs, understand the transaction configurations of your organization. You can see the transaction related settings on InTouch > Settings > Systems & Deployment > InTouch PoS Configuration > Billing.\nMandatory parameters required to submit a transaction\nWhether Retro Transaction is enabled to convert not-interested transactions to regular transactions and the maximum duration for which retro transaction is allowed\nWhether Authorization is required for retro transactions\nWhether Transaction Return is enabled for your organization (for transaction returns)\nScope of transaction numbers to be unique (store level or TILL level) and duration for which repetition is not allowed (20 days, 30 days etc.)\nMaximum and minimum amount allowed per transaction\nMaximum and minimum amount allowed per line-item\n\ud83d\udcd8\nIgnore error headers. It is still in the evaluation phase.\nStatus Codes\nSuccess Codes\nCode\nDescription\n600\nTransaction added successfully.\nTransaction retrieved successfully.\nTransaction updated successfully.\n1630\nTransaction marked as regular through Retro conversion.
